# BIG-SCALE-VEGETABLE-MARKET-MANAGEMENT-AND-LOAN-SYSTEM
The main idea is to implement the concepts of OOP and real-world problem-solving skills to 
implement this management system. This program will not only provide Registration system for 
customer, but also some other features like keeping check of daily sales, and keeping track of 
total balance .
Previously, vegetable merchants and their customers had to go through inefficient and 
time-consuming methods to register themselves and buy products which ended up wasting 
their valuable time and resources. The records of dailysale and the remaining balance of 
customers was input into the registers or copies through clerks which was vulnerable to human 
errors and led to the inefficient usage of clerks' time. Moreover, the data that was present in 
the paper registers was prone to get lost due to any accidental fires in the shops or the loss of 
register copies. This led to the uncertainty in the buyers' mind when paying the amount and 
thus this caused certain commotion and arguments in the sabzi mandi. 
To encounter the mentioned problems, we decided to build an application consisting of 
features that would help to fight off the inefficiency in the sabzi mandi. Our program consists of
three main function i.e. keeping track of daily sale, keeping track of customers' information, 
keeping track of finances. The method of payment is subdivided into two further methods 
namely the on day payments and the delayed payments. The class ondaypayment receives the 
(some/all) payment from customer from the same day on which he has purchased the 
vegetable, whereas the class delayed payment accepts payment from the customer from any of 
his previous purchase of which the payment is pending. The customer class records the 
customers information, with their unique code which helps in finding data with ease ,and shows 
all the registered customers. It further includes a balance class which is password protected 
since it contains confidential data for the merchant, this class saves remaining balance and 
received balance for having an overview of the business. The daily sale function looks after the 
details of the purchase of vegetables i.e.- the quantity of the vegetables and the number of 
bags , hence these solutions would help organize data and keep track of it.
All the functions present in the project are as follows :-
• Register customer
• Selling vegetables
• Recording dailysales 
i. Editing dailysales
ii. Deleting dailysales
iii. Searcing dailysales
iv. Issuing dailysale receipt
• Receive payment
v. On the day of purchase
vi. Delayed payment
vii. Issuing receipts of both payment methods
• Keep track of transactions
viii.Total remaining amount
ix. Total received amount
